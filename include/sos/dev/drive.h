 *
 * \details This is the interface for accessing drives.
 *
 * The drive is usually one of two types:
 *
 * - Serial Flash (mostly use command flash interface)
 * - SD/MMC Flash memory
 *
 * ## Terminology
 *
 * - Page: the size of a writeable chunk of memory
 * - Sector: the size of an eraseable chunk of memory (commonly 4KB on serial NAND devices)
 *
 * Multiple pages typically make up a sector. Pages are aligned to sector boundaries.
